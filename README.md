## Project Outline
### My Design Choices:

I wanted to indicate my level of understanding in terms of what I've learned by showcasing different levels to each button, ranging from beginner to immtermediate and then advanced. 
- **BUTTON 1** is inspired by one of the reference buttons that reflects a simple hover effect that changes color when hovering on the button, along with a linear-gradient effect that displays 2 different colors when you hover on the button.
- **BUTTON 2** is also inspired by one of the reference buttons that reflects a transparent background while outlining the border when hovering on the button.
- **BUTTON 3** reflects a more advanced understanding of animations. Although, I haven't added any hovering effect as the button only infinitely glows in the background, it adds a colorful attraction to the button itself which may easily attract the attention of a user.

### Challenges:

I initially codepened the reference buttons, commenting out the css properties to reflect the changes to better understand what is happening. Most of what you learn in the coursework is pretty much specific so when you have the starter code, it's a bit tricky distinguishing changes that is already there. 

I had fun figuring out which colors to use for the buttons, although it took some time to get the colors that I feel is user-friendly and eay-catching. Playing around with hex and rgb code can be tricky and confusing at first but you get the hang of it once you understand how it's being applied.

I particularly like the glowing button.
